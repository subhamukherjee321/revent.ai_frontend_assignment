## Challenges Faced
- During the development of this project, I encountered the following challenges:

- Filtering Implementation: Implementing a robust filtering mechanism that efficiently filters products based on categories and price range also apply multiple filting at the same time.

- Responsive Design: Ensuring that the component provides an optimal user experience across various devices and screen sizes, including handling layout and styling.

- Data Management: Managing and displaying product data efficiently, including handling dynamic updates based on filters and search.

## Thought Process
- In building this dynamic product showcase component, my thought process was as follows:

- Design Considerations: Focus on creating an intuitive and visually appealing user interface. Pay attention to usability and accessibility principles.

- Data Source: Use mock data or create a simple JSON file to simulate the product data.

- React Development: Leverage React.js to build the web component, utilizing React components, state management, and event handling.

- Filtering and Search & Sort: Implement filtering, search and sort functionality to allow users to find products based on their preferences.

- Responsiveness: Ensure that the component is fully responsive by using CSS and media queries to adapt to different screen sizes.
